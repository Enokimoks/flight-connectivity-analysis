# Flight Connectivity Analysis

This repository contains exploratory data analysis projects focused on
understanding flight connectivity patterns using publicly available
aviation datasets.

The goal of this project is to build strong foundations in:
- Data analysis
- Data cleaning and exploration
- Insight communication using real-world datasets

This is a learning-in-progress repository and will be updated once in a while as new analysis are added
